Counting nodes in the linked list can be done by following easy steps below:

Take a copy of head pointer, say temp.
Now, start traversing through the linked list until you encounter the link(next) of temp (temp->next) as NULL.
While traversing through the linked list, just keep count of the nodes you traversed.
Count of nodes traversed will be the answer.
